# PythonForDataScience
Final Project for EN.553.287

This is a Jupyter Notebook containing some data analyses on the CMS (Medicare) Synthetic Beneficiary File, which is a deidentified database of patient healthcare costs, demographics, and chronic condition history. This analysis uses Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to display, summarize, and predict healthcare costs of beneficiaries. Clone the notebook and use rjupyter or a local Notebook to run.
